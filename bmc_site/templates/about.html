<p><strong>Public Training</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Skilllinx Training and Development programs have been developed and are continually updated, based not only on the latest international Management principles and practices, but also on field research, first-hand experience, in-depth knowledge of the region and the specific requirements of organisations. Public training programs are open to participants from any organisation. These participants have the opportunity to concentrate on their learning away from the job and without the pressures of day-to-day work. Participants also benefit from sharing experiences with people from other organisations and gain a new perspective on common problems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Public training programs are open to participants from any organisation. These participants have the opportunity to concentrate on their learning away from the job and without the pressures of day-to-day work. Participants also benefit from sharing experiences with people from other organisations and gain a new perspective on common problems. Skilllinx relies on a variety of training and facilitation methods and techniques. Used whenever applicable, these methods are aimed at enhancing individual and group interaction while maximising learning. Some of these methods are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brief presentations by the consultant.</li>
	<li>Group debriefs.</li>
	<li>Individual and team exercises, indoors and outdoors.</li>
	<li>Behaviour modeling and role-plays.</li>
	<li>One-to-one and group discussions.</li>
	<li>Case studies, simulations and small projects.</li>
	<li>Individual action plans (to follow up and evaluate training results).</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure the concepts and skills introduced in our programs are duly transferred to the workplace, Skilllinx is ready to incorporate an "action plan" section at the end of any training program. This section will constitute an integral part of the training and will be completed by the participants before the closing of the program.</p>
